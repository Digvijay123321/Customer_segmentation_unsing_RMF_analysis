# Customer Segmentation unsing RMF Analysis


## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of online commerce, understanding and engaging with customers on a nuanced level is crucial for long-term success. This project explores customer behavior using the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis framework. RFM segmentation categorizes customers based on their transaction frequency, recency, and monetary value, offering actionable insights for businesses to tailor marketing strategies and optimize customer retention.

By analyzing the eCommerce dataset through the lens of RFM, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and trends, providing businesses with a comprehensive understanding of customer interactions and behaviors. This project will result in the creation of distinct customer segments, each representing a group with similar purchasing habits, enabling businesses to refine their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
